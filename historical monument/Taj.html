<p><h2>HISTORY OF TAJ MAHAL</h2><p>
</center>
<p><h4>The Taj Mahal of Agra is one of the Seven Wonders of the World, for reasons more than just looking magnificent. It's the history of Taj Mahal that adds a soul to its magnificence: a soul that is filled with love, loss, remorse, and love again. Because if it was not for love, the world would have been robbed of a fine example upon which people base their relationships. An example of how deeply a man loved his wife, that even after she remained but a memory, he made sure that this memory would never fade away. This man was the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who was head-over-heels in love with Mumtaz Mahal, his dear wife. She was a Muslim Persian princess (her name Arjumand Banu Begum before marriage) and he was the son of the Mughal Emperor Jehangir and grandson of Akbar the Great. It was at the age of 14 that he met Mumtaz and fell in love with her. Five years later in the year 1612, they got married.

Mumtaz Mahal, an inseparable companion of Shah Jahan, died in 1631, while giving birth to their 14th child. It was in the memory of his beloved wife that Shah Jahan built a magnificent monument as a tribute to her, which we today know as the "Taj Mahal". The construction of Taj Mahal started in the year 1631. Masons, stonecutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome-builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from Central Asia and Iran, and it took approximately 22 years to build what we see today. An epitome of love, it made use of the services of 22,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants. The monument was built entirely out of white marble, which was brought in from all over India and central Asia. After an expenditure of approximately 32 million rupees, Taj Mahal was finally completed in the year 1653.

It was soon after the completion of Taj Mahal that Shah Jahan was deposed by his own son Aurangzeb and was put under house arrest at nearby Agra Fort. Shah Jahan, himself also, lies entombed in this mausoleum along with his wife. Moving further down the history, it was at the end of the 19th century that British Viceroy Lord Curzon ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908, as a measure to restore what was lost during the Indian rebellion of 1857: Taj being blemished by British soldiers and government officials who also deprived the monument of its immaculate beauty by chiseling out precious stones and lapis lazuli from its walls. Also, the British style lawns that we see today adding on to the beauty of Taj were remodeled around the same time. Despite prevailing controversies, past and present threats from Indo-Pak war and environmental pollution, this epitome of love continuous to shine and attract people from all over the world.

<p><h2>INSPIRATION<h2><p>
<p><h4>The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, to be built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, a Persian princess who died giving birth to their 14th child, Gauhara Begum.[7] Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632.[8] The imperial court documenting Shah Jahan's grief after the death of Mumtaz Mahal illustrate the love story held as the inspiration for Taj Mahal.[9][10] The principal mausoleum was completed in 1643[8] and the surrounding buildings and garden were finished about five years later.[citation needed]</h4></p>
<p><h2>Architecture and design</h2></p>
<p><h4>The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),[11] Humayun's Tomb, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the Baby Taj), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.</h4></p>
<p><h2>Tomb<h2><p>
<p><h4>The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan (an arch-shaped doorway) topped by a large dome and finial. Like most Mughal tombs, the basic elements are Persian in origin.[13]

The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres (180 ft) on each of the four long sides. Each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. This motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas, making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building. Four minarets frame the tomb, one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners. The main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan; the actual graves are at a lower level.</h4></p>

<p><h3>India's Monument&Love</h3><p>
</center>
<p><h4>The Taj Mahal is one of the wonders of the world, it is also a symbol of love. The Taj Majal in India was bult during 1631-1653 by Shah Jahan a well known Moghul Emperor. The entire premises that houses the Taj Mahal is so large, that it needed over 20 years to complete it's construction. Though the Taj was dedicated to Mumtaz Mahal his wife, it was built after her death. This shows how much Shah Jahan loved his wife, it proudly stands till today as a symbol of love. The meaning of Taj Mahal would be 'The Crown Palace', at least part of the name came from the name of his wife's name Mumtaz Mahal. The historic monument stands of the banks of the river Yamuna in North India. It is said that the cost of building the Taj Mahal was around 7 million dollars which was indeed a very huge amount at that time. The intricate work around the Taj Mahal both inside and outside was painstakingly done by more than 20,000 craftsmen and artisans.

It is said that Shah Jahan was very impressed by the completed consctruction and wanted to make sure that there would never be another monument as beautiful as the Taj Mahal. This drove him to commit one of the most horrific crimes recorded in history, he chopped off the hands of all the 20,000 craftsmen. This sadly implies that he ruined at least 20,000 families as the craftsmen could never work again. Most reports and tourist publications skim over this senseless crime and instead present the physical features of the Taj Mahal.</h4></p>

<p><h4>The Taj Mahal took over 20 years to build, a substantial amount of this time was spent to get the marble and jasper stone that was used to construct this stunning monument. The four minarets that you see in the above image are tilted a bit, they tilt away from the monument. This not a mistake, it is also not something that occured over time. The brains that designed this beauty made provisions for an earthquake. It was believed that a strong earthquake could cause the minarets to fall down. With the slight outward tilt, the minarets were more likely to fall outwards and therefore away from the Taj Mahal. Each minaret is over 130 feet tall and has a view post (closed balcony) on the top.</h4></p>

<p><h4>The board of chief architects who managed the entire design and construction of this magnifcient symbom of love was believed to be lead by Ustad Ahamed Lahauri. It is not clear whether the selected team of designers remained constant throughout the 20 years that it took to complete the construction of the Taj Mahal. Mumtaz Mahal was Emperor Shah Jahan's 13th wife and the couple is believed to have had 14 children together. Mumtaz Mahal died during the delivery of their 14th child.

Shah Jahan was believed to have used these words to describe the Taj Mahal after it was completed. It was like a monument of all monuments on this planet.</h4></p>

<p><h4>The Taj Mahal is located in the Indian city of Agra. This city belongs to the state of Uttar Pradesh. Winters can be very cold and foggy, summers are extremely hot. If you plan to make a trip to see the Taj, it is best to take the help of a conducted tour. Like most tourists places across the globe, cheats and tricksters are often around to play their gimmicks on innocent tourists. Carry your drinking water and avoid hot or cold drinks as they can be unhygenic. Making a trip in the hot summers also means that foodstuffs are more likely to get spoilt by the severe heat. If travelling to see the Taj Mahal in the winter, try to find out whether the location is covered with fog before you travel there. To get the best photographs, you need a crisp sun and a clear day. Most of the photographs on this page would have looked far more attractive with a few clouds in the sky!

<p><h4>Shah Jahan was originally Prince Khurram, the son of the Moghul Emporer Jehangir. Mumtaz Mahal was a Persian Princess named Arjumand Banu Begum before her marriage to Shah Jahan. The two met when Shah Jahan (then Prince Khurram) was just 14 years old, they got married about five years later. Shah Jahan had many wives but Mumtaz was the one he loved the most, the Taj Mahal was built in her memory.

History records that Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son and imprisoned by his own son. He died a prisoner leaving behind a massive and amazing monument that is today one of the most recognized constructions in the world. The Taj Mahal Hotel in Bombay (India) is in no way related to the Taj Mahal in Agra. The hotel interestingly was the scene of a massive terrorist attack a few years ago. Islamic terrorists, took control of the hotel and killed dozens of innocent occupants. The hotel itself was burnt and bombed as hundreds of armed commandos ran after a handful of terrorist holed up in the hotel.
